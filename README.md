# Simulink Viewer 
The aim of this project is to develop a software tool that can read Simulink MDL files and display their contents in a user-friendly way using a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI). Simulink is a popular simulation and modeling environment used in various industries, including automotive, aerospace, and electronics. The Simulink MDL files contain the model information, which is used to simulate and analyze the system behavior.
The tool allows to load Simulink MDL files and view their contents in a hierarchical structure, navigate through the model components and see their properties and connections.
